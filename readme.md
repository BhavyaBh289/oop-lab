4. A Company manufactures Vehicles, which could be a Helicopter, a Car, or a Train depending on the customer‚Äôs demand. Each Vehicle instance has a method called move, which prints on the console the nature of movement of the vehicle.

5. We have to calculate the percentage of marks obtained in three subjects (each out of 100) by student A and in four subjects (each out of 100) by student B. Create an abstract class 'Marks' with an abstract method 'getPercentage'. It is inherited by two other classes 'A' and 'B' each having a method with the same name which returns the percentage of the students. The constructor of student A takes the marks in three subjects as its parameters and the marks in four subjects as its parameters for student B. Create an object for eac of the two classes and print the percentage of marks for both the students.

6. Write the following code in your editor below:
A class named Arithmetic with a method named add that takes 2 integers as parameters and returns an integer denoting their sum.
A class named Adder that inherits from a superclass named Arithmetic. The main method in the Tester class should print the following: SAMPLE O/P:My superclass is: Arithmetic
42 13 20

7. You are required to compute the power of a number by implementing a calculator. Create a class My Calculator which consists of a single method long power (int, int). This method takes two integers n and p, as parameters and finds (n)p. If either or is negative, then the method must throw an exception which says " n or p should not be negative‚Äù. Also, if both and are zero, then the method must throw an exception which says "n or p should not be negative‚Äù.

8. You are given a phone book that consists of people's names and their phone number. After that you will be given some person's name as query. For each query, print the phone number of that person. Use HashMap to implement it.The first line will have an integer denoting the number of entries in the phone book. Each entry consists of two lines: a name and the corresponding phone number.
After these, there will be some queries. Each query will contain a person's name. Read the queries until end-of-file.
Constraints:
A person's name consists of only lower-case English letters and it may be in the format 'first-name last-name' or in the format 'first-name'. Each phone number has exactly 8 digits without any leading zeros.For each case, print "Not found" if the person has no entry in the phone book. Otherwise, print the person's name and phone number.
